# Setup

The project uses `ivy` and `ant` for resolving dependencies and
building, respectively.

simply clone the repo and run:

```
ant resolve && ant test
```

To build the lib run `ant jar`, it outputs to `./jar`.

There are examples on usage at the [demoes repository](https://www.github.com/jensecj/flatlab-java-demoes).
